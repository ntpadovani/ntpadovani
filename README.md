### Holberton School [AirBnB Clone] (Project-1-URL)

- In this project we mimicked the AirBnB website in order to have hands on/real world experience with the technologies needed to create such design, and also to understand what procedures/steps are used in this type of complex develpment.
- SQL and Python were used to store and manage the website's data information and to handle backend operations. For frontend operations we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja and Flask.
- We created an API to stablish a bridge between the frontend and the backend, but also to ensure the best performance possible thus allowing the user to have a hassle free interaction.
